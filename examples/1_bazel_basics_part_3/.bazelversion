# It is higly recommended to specify a fixed Bazel version.
#
# Some Bazel features are still maturing, so you would probably want to schedule
# a time window to tackle all possible breaking changes.
#
# Check the official documentation about backwards compatibility:
# https://bazel.build/release/backward-compatibility
